# Statistical Models for Time Series Analysis with Categorical Target Variable

This repository provides implementations and experiments on statistical models tailored for "time series data with a categorical target variable". Traditional time series models often focus on numerical forecasting, but this project explores classification-based approaches, bridging time-dependent features with categorical outcomes. This is my research case study of University of trier. I want to take a moment to clarify that the paper shared here has been obtained with the full consent and support of my team.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Explore statistical methods for classifying categorical outcomes over time
- Implement advanced models for time series classification
- Analyze model performance using AIC and BIC
- Provide reproducible code and experiments

ðŸ§® Applications

- Gene expression states across time
- Product stock status over time
- User viewing behavior (Sports, News, etc)
- Credit rating over the time 
  
ðŸ§  Models Implemented

- Markov chain model
- Hidden Markov model
- Discrete NDARMA
- Multinomial logistic model
- Spectral Envelope
- Rate Evolution Graph
